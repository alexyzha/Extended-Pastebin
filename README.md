Once you have it downloaded, this is the program you want to use. This is what it looks like on GitHub:

Have fun with it! :)

> If you're going to use it often, I recommend keeping it at dock or somewhere that's easily accessible. You can do this by dragging the app into dock manually, since it won't ever show the app as running in dock otherwise.

# About Extended Pastebin:

- When the app is launched, you'll have 10 spaces, all "\[Empty]". If you click an empty button, nothing will be copied. You can, however, write over it.
- The buttons will display the text you paste into them.
- Any string longer than 25 characters will be truncated in the text preview, but you'll still copy the whole string when you click it.
- The popover doesn't have the transient property, meaning that it will stay open until you click the app icon again. This is meant to facilitate copying multiple things from one page :)

# How to use:

- Single click to copy whatever text is displayed in the button (unless the text is "[Empty").
- \[Command + Click] to paste whatever you have in your pastebin into the selected button (whatever button your mouse is hovering over).

This is the icon for the app, and I made it using [this onine tool.](https://onlinepngtools.com/convert-text-to-png) It's just a C (for **C**opy) followed by 2 superscript "+". This is because I love C++ ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©
