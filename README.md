Have fun with it! :)

If you're going to use it often, I recommend keeping it at dock. You can do this by dragging the app into dock manually, since it wont ever show the app as running in dock otherwise.

# About Extended Pastebin:

- When the app is launched, you'll have 10 spaces, all "\[Empty]". If you click an empty button, nothing will be copied. You can, however, write over it.
- The buttons will display the text you paste into them.
- Any string longer than 25 characters will be truncated in the text preview, but you'll still copy the whole string when you click it.

# How to use:

- Single click to copy whatever text is displayed in the button (unless the text is "[Empty").
- \[Command + Click] to paste whatever you have in your pastebin into the selected button (whatever button your mouse is hovering over).
